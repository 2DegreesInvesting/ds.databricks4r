# Introduction to Databricks for R analysts and developers

The goal of this series is to help R users understand if and how they
can do in Databricks the things they already do elsewhere – mainly un
RStudio and the Terminal.

At the end of this series you’ll be able to do things like this:

- Understand the Databricks UI: Workspace, repos, and catalog.
- Understand the difference and ralationship with Azure storage.
- Understand GitHub connection and limitations.
- Understand clusters and limitations.
- Understand notebooks and limitations.
- Understand how to use RStudio in the cloud and limitations.

## Who is the audience?

Analysts and developers used to working with R from the RStudio IDE.

## Why is this important?

Databricks allows you to work with data at scale from a simple
interface. With that simple interface you can do powerful things, but
not all the things you typically do in RStudio, and not in the way
you’re used to. For example, it changes the way you install some
software, read, and manipulate data. Recognizing the intended use of
Databricks is crucial to avoid mistakes and friction.
